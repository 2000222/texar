-----------------

**Texar** is an open-source toolkit based on Tensorflow to support a 
broad set of machine learning, especially **text generation** tasks,
such as
  * machine translation, dialog, summarization, content manipulation, 
  language modeling, ...

With the design goals of **modularity, versatility, and extensibility** 
in mind, Texar extacts the common patterns 
underlying the diverse tasks and methodologies, creates a library of 
highly reusable modules and functionalities, and facilitates
**arbitrary model architectures**, e.g., 
  * sequence-to-sequence, (multi-)encoder to (multi-)decoder, 
  sequential and self attentions, memory, hierarchical models, 
  probabilistic models, ... 

and **various algorithmic paradigms**, e.g.,
  * Maximum likelihood learning, reinforcement learning, adversarial 
  learning, ...
