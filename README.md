 -----------------
 
 **Texar** is an open-source toolkit based on Tensorflow to support a broad set of machine learning, especially **text generation tasks**, such as
   * machine translation, dialog, summarization, content manipulation, language modeling, ... 
 
 With the design goals of **modularity, versatility, and extensibility** in mind, Texar extacts the common patterns underlying the diverse tasks and methodologies, creates a library of highly reusable modules and functionalities, and facilitates **arbitrary model architectures and algorithmic paradigms**, e.g., 
   * encoder(s) to decoder(s), sequential- and self-attentions, memory, hierarchical models, classifiers... 
   * maximum likelihood learning, reinforcement learning, adversarial learning, probabilistic modeling, ...
