## Augmented Data Generation for RAML Algorithm

Codes here are mainly copied from [pcyin's github](https://github.com/pcyin/pytorch_nmt), with slightly change for supporting ```rouge``` as reward. Note that we have provided generated samples in the dataset you can download. This codes are for you to tune the hyperparameters for generating samples.



You can tune the hyperparameters in ```gen_samples_giga.sh```  or  ```gen_samples_iwslt14.sh```  and use commands like ```bash gen_samples_giga.sh``` to begin your generation.
